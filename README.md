# Sea-animals-classification

The dataset contains different images of marine animals. Some images were taken from pixabay.com and requires no license or attribution when used. Other images were taken from flickr.com where attribution to the original authors will be required when used commercially. Currently, there are 19 different classes available and may be extended further in the future. The images are resized to either (300px, n) or (n,300px) where n is a pixel size less than 300px
